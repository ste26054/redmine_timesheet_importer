= Redmine Timesheet Importer (CSV)

Based on:
https://github.com/leovitch/redmine_importer. I have removed the issue creation feature and the plugin appears on the top menu (Not project limited)

DB migration is required for this plugin

Allows administrators to import CSV formated timesheets

Here are the headers required (a mapping is possible):

Column:		id	user_login	update_date	Hours	Comment	Activity	Notes
Required:	*	*			*			*				*
